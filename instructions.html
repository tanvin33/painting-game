    <h2>Here's how to use paint!</h2>
    <p>
      Use this application to sketch for fun, to relax, or to create your own
      masterpiece! <br />
    </p>
    <h3>
      Basics
    </h3>
    <p>
      Start painting by holding down and dragging your mouse on the canvas.<br />

      <br />
      Select a color by hovering over the "colorbar" at the top. Your chosen
      color will appear at the side.
      <br />
      <br />
      Click on the red "eraser" button to toggle the eraser on and off.
      <br />
    </p>
    <h3>
      Color Model
    </h3>
    <p>
      We use the HSB (hue, saturation, brightness) color model. <br />
      <br />
      This means that all the colors at the "colorbar" on top match well
      together as they represent all the hues at one saturation and brightness
      <br />
      <br />
      Use the sliders in the toolbox to adjust the saturation, brightness, and
      opacity of your chosen color, as well as the "colorbar" up top. <br />
      <br />
      The brush weight slider changes the size of your brush. To help you
      visualize this, the circle underneath is an accurate representation of
      your brush size. <br />
